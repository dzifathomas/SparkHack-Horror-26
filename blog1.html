                Hey everyone,
            </p>

            <p>
                So I'm subletting this apartment for a week while Alex is "traveling." Mrs. Henderson, the landlady, gave me the keys with the weirdest warning: "The walls whisper here. Don't answer back if you value your sanity."
            </p>

            <p class="whisper">
                The place is... charmingly retro? That's a nice way of saying everything's from the 70s. Olive green fridge, wood paneling, and this ancient desktop computer that was left on. It has this blog open—Alex's, I guess.

            </p>

            <p>
                Found some weird stuff already:

                Scratches inside the closet door—not animal claws, more like... fingernails?
                
                All the mirrors are covered with sheets
                
                There's a landline that keeps getting calls from "Unknown"
                
                
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="horror-image-container">
            <img src="assets/Day-1.jpg" 
                 alt="Something is wrong here" 
                 class="horror-image">
        </div>

        <div class="choices">

            <h3>What should I do tonight?</h3>

            <button onclick="makeChoice(3)">
                Uncover a mirror
            </button>

            <button onclick="makeChoice(4)">
                Answer landline
            </button>

            <button onclick="makeChoice(2)">
                Check computer
            </button>

            <button onclick="makeChoice(1)">
                Go to sleep
            </button>

        <div id="result"></div>

        <div class="next-day-container">
            <button id="nextDayButton" onclick="goToNextDay()">
                → Next Day: DAY 2
            </button>
